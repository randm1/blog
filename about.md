# About Me
<aside markdown="1">
Hello, I'm Samuel, but you can call me Sam. I was born in **Texas**, but have lived in **Colorado** for the vast majority of my life. I am currently a highschooler dealing with highschool things, so this site may see peroids of time where I don't upload much, but I'll keep trying my best.

Most of my intrests are in the technology landsape, including software (FOSS in particular), electronics, video games, and finding my way around playing the guitar. I am a proud Christian, too.
