If you have looked at one of my two posts here before and remember this blog exists, you probably noticed that it looks completely different. I have also implemented some new features to this blog. Enjoy!

## The Redesign
The most obvious update is the completely new theme. I tried going for a dark, clean, semi-retro look. The bright colors and rounded corners didn't really fit what I wanted. Some aspects still need tweaking, but of course it will never be done. Overall, I am really happy with it! Credit to [joelchrono](https://fosstodon.org/@joel) for his fluxbox code I permanently borrowed. It can be seen in my about page and home page, and probably more pages to come. I did reference his style sheet and layouts quite a bit, too. I already liked the general layout of his website, and as a student I don’t have much time to dedicate to writing my entire style and features by hand. But, this site should gradually become more unique as I tweak it more to fit me. I don't wanna be a copycat forever!

## About Page
I spent some time making a more personal about page, rather than just a copy/paste of my Mastodon bio. 

## RSS
If you want to add my blog to your RSS feed, now you can! Clicking the subscribe button in the nav bar will take you to a web view of the feed with instructions on how to subscribe. The page is Joel's adaptation of Simone Silvestroni’s code for Atom, which you can read more about [here](https://joelchrono.xyz/blog/improving-my-rss-feed/).

## Comments
You can now view comments directly on this blog! Comments are made through Mastodon. To sum it up, all I have to do is link a blog post to a Mastodon post, then all comments made there are shown here. If you want to add comments to your blog, I recommend you check out this [guide](https://joelchrono.xyz/blog/how-to-add-mastodon-comments-to-jekyll-blog/).

## TODO
As of right now, I still want to:
* Add thumbnails for social media embeds
* Add more awesome web badges
* Organize my blog page
* Get or make a proper SVG logo
