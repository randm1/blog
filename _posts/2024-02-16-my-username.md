In a lot of places on the internet, my username is randm (pronounced "random"). It's not that meaningful, so if you were expecting some hyper-intellect reason or connection to me, so if you were expecting that sorry to let ya down.
Anyways it came from a Minecraft username I made, _RandomNPC. Origins of that? There was no reason behind it, I just thought it sounded cool. I started using that username on places other than Minecraft, but dropped the "NPC" part of it to just "Random". The one problem was that that username was taken in many places, obviously, and I despice putting pointless numbers in a username. It just looks bad to me, and I don't even have a reason to look profesional. So I dropped the "o" to jusy end up with "Randm". I think its a pretty decent username.
