As my first blog post, I don't know much about how to get started, so I'm just gonna dive in.

<h1>Why?</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@joel" target="_blank">Joel G.</a> has a pretty cool blog, whis is what really sparked the idea to start a blog in me.
    </li>
    <li>
      I want to learn more about HTML and CSS. This would be a fun way to do so.
    </li>
    <li>
      I need something to do so I don't end up doomscrolling on my phone. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    </li>
  </ul>

<h1>How?</h1>

I decided to go with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as the tool for creating this website. It just seemed like a fairly straightforward way to go about this. Jeykyll is not that hard to set up, even for me who has an extremely limited background in HTML. Again, I need to thank Joel as I referenced a lot of his [code](https://github.com/joelchrono12/joelchrono12.ml/tree/main) and learned a lot about Jekyll trough poking around.

 If you want to set up your own Jekyll blog, you are able to host it on GitHub pages. Personally, im running it on a pertty compitent Linode for $5/mo. Jekyll has a pretty good [tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) for a basic setup and to get your bearings.

<h1>The Future</h1>
I hope to get this site in an acceptable state in a few weeks and post every so often. I encourage you to set up a blog too! I think I'm even going to join [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/).

This is day 1 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/)
