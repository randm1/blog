<p>As my first blog post, I donâ€™t know much about how to get started, so Iâ€™m just gonna dive in.</p>

<h1>Why?</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@joel" target="_blank">Joel G.</a> has a pretty cool blog, whis is what really sparked the idea to start a blog in me.
    </li>
    <li>
      I want to learn more about HTML and CSS. This would be a fun way to do so.
    </li>
    <li>
      I need something to do so I don't end up doomscrolling on my phone. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
    </li>
  </ul>

<h1>How?</h1>

<p>I decided to go with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> as the tool for creating this website. It just seemed like a fairly straightforward way to go about this. Jeykyll is not that hard to set up, even for me who has an extremely limited background in HTML. Again, I need to thank Joel as I referenced a lot of his <a href="https://github.com/joelchrono12/joelchrono12.ml/tree/main">code</a> and learned a lot about Jekyll trough poking around.</p>

<p>If you want to set up your own Jekyll blog, you are able to host it on GitHub pages. Personally, im running it on a pertty compitent Linode for $5/mo. Jekyll has a pretty good <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">tutorial</a> for a basic setup and to get your bearings.</p>

<h1>The Future</h1>
<p>I hope to get this site in an acceptable state in a few weeks and post every so often. I encourage you to set up a blog too! I think Iâ€™m even going to join <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">#100DaysToOffload</a>.</p>

<p>This is day 1 of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">#100DaysToOffload</a></p>
